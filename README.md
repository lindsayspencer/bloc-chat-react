# YouOn? Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It has not been styled.

## Overview

In the project, I built a chat app using React.js and connected to Firebase for database storage of rooms and messages. Features include:

- switching between chat rooms
- chat room messages display on select
- current room updates on select
- allows user sign in with Google account
